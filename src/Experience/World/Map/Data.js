        Deolinda Rodrigues was a prominent Angolan nationalist, militant, writer, and translator active in the independence movement against Portuguese colonial rule in Angola. She was born in 1939 and became involved in the anti-colonial struggle at a young age, dedicating her life to the cause. Rodrigues was a charismatic and inspiring leader, known for her passion and commitment to the independence movement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        As a writer and translator, Rodrigues used her literary skills to spread the message of Angolan independence. Her works, including poems, essays, and speeches, celebrated the struggle for freedom and justice in Angola and inspired others to join the movement. She also translated works by African and other international writers into Portuguese, making these works available to Angolan readers and broadening their cultural horizons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Rodrigues was also a militant and an active participant in the armed struggle against Portuguese colonial rule. She was arrested several times for her political activities and spent time in prison, where she continued to write and translate. Despite the risks, she remained steadfast in her commitment to the cause, inspiring others with her courage and determination.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Tragically, Rodrigues was killed in 1967 during a military operation against Portuguese forces. Her death was a loss to the independence movement, but her legacy lived on. She is remembered as a courageous and dedicated leader who fought for the freedom and dignity of her people, and her writings continue to inspire others in their quest for justice and equality.

      textContent: `<p>
        Queen Nzinga was a powerful 17th century ruler of the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms in what is now Angola. She is remembered for her strong leadership and resistance against the Portuguese colonists who sought to control her people and their resources.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Nzinga was born into the ruling class of the Ndongo kingdom in 1583, and her brother was the king at the time. When her brother died, Nzinga was passed over for the throne in favour of her nephew, but she was determined to take control. She formed alliances with other kingdoms and used diplomatic tactics and military force to gain power.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        One of her most famous acts of resistance was in 1622, when she led her army in a battle against the Portuguese. Despite being outnumbered, her army was able to defeat the Portuguese and drive them out of her kingdom. This was a significant victory for Nzinga and her people, and it helped to establish her as a powerful leader.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Nzinga also used her power to improve the lives of her people. She abolished the slave trade within her kingdom, and she worked to improve the economic and social conditions for her subjects. She also encouraged education and the arts, and she was known for her patronage of poets and musicians.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Despite her many achievements, Nzinga's kingdom was eventually conquered by the Portuguese, and she was forced to retreat to the kingdom of Matamba. However, she continued to resist the colonisers and maintained her power until her death in 1663.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Queen Nzinga remains an important figure in African history, as she was one of the few women to have held such a powerful position during this time period. Her legacy lives on in Angola, where she is celebrated as a symbol of resistance and strength.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        It's important to note that some of the historical records of Queen Nzinga's life were written by the Portuguese colonists, who may have had biases. Therefore, the details of her life and her accomplishments may not be entirely accurate. Despite this, her legacy as a powerful leader who fought against colonialism continues to be celebrated today.

      textContent: `<p>
        The Dahomey Amazons were a group of female warriors who served the kingdom of Dahomey, located in what is now modern-day Benin, in West Africa. They were formed in the 17th century and were known for their bravery and skill in battle. These women were selected from the most physically fit and agile members of Dahomey society and were trained in combat and weapons use. They were equipped with muskets, swords, and clubs, and were considered an elite military force.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Dahomey Amazons were particularly feared by neighbouring kingdoms, who would often surrender without a fight in their presence. They were also an important part of the Dahomey kingdom's political power and were used to enforce the king's will. The Amazons also played a role in Dahomey's slave trade, capturing and selling slaves to European traders.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Despite their fierce reputation, the Dahomey Amazons were also a symbol of female empowerment in a society that often relegated women to secondary roles. The women of the Amazon society had a unique set of rights and privileges that were not afforded to other women in Dahomey. They were able to marry, own property, and lead independent lives, free from the restrictions imposed on other women.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The Dahomey Amazons were eventually disbanded in the late 19th century as European colonial powers gained control of West Africa. However, their legacy remains an important part of the cultural heritage of West Africa, and they continue to inspire modern-day women who seek to challenge traditional gender roles and strive for equality. The Dahomey Amazons serve as a powerful reminder of the strength and resilience of women, and the impact they can have on history and society.

      Alice Nkom is a Cameroonian human rights lawyer and LGBTQ rights activist. She is known for her work defending the rights of marginalised communities, particularly those of the LGBTQ community in Cameroon. Nkom has been instrumental in fighting against the criminalization of homosexuality in Cameroon and has helped many LGBTQ individuals in the country to avoid prosecution and discrimination.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Nkom began her career as a lawyer in the 1970s and quickly realised that the rights of marginalised communities were not being adequately protected. She decided to focus her efforts on defending the rights of these groups, particularly those of the LGBTQ community. Nkom has faced numerous challenges in her work, including death threats and physical assaults, but she remains dedicated to fighting for the rights of marginalised communities.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In addition to her legal work, Nkom is also an advocate for education and awareness about LGBTQ rights in Cameroon. She has spoken at numerous conferences and events, and has worked with international organisations to promote the rights of LGBTQ individuals in the country.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Despite the many challenges she has faced, Nkom remains committed to her work. She continues to fight for the rights of marginalised communities in Cameroon and is an inspiration to many people around the world. Nkom's tireless efforts have led to significant improvements in the lives of LGBTQ individuals in Cameroon and her work has been recognized by many organisations, including Amnesty International and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Alice Nkom's work is important because it has helped to change the perception of LGBTQ individuals in Cameroon, and has helped to promote acceptance and tolerance in the country. Her efforts have helped to create a more inclusive society and have helped to protect the rights of marginalised communities. Nkom's work is a reminder of the power of one person to make a difference, and her dedication and commitment to fighting for the rights of marginalised communities should be celebrated and emulated.

      Jeanne-Marie Ruth-Rolland (n√©e Rolland) was a Central African politician, social worker, and teacher who died on June 4, 1995. She is widely recognised as Africa's first female presidential candidate.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Ruth-Rolland joined the cabinet as an advisor in 1979 and was later appointed Minister for the Advancement of Women's Status. During this time, she worked extensively with street children and was dubbed "Aunt Ruth," a moniker she retained throughout her life. Ruth-Rolland presided over the Central African Red Cross. She created and led the Central African Republican Party during this time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Ruth-Rolland ran in the first multiparty elections in 1992 and was elected deputy for the Bakouma seat. She ran as the leader of the Civic Forum party because her own political party had not yet been legalised at the time of the election. However, the election was called off by the Supreme Court and re-held the following year in 1993, when Ruth-Rolland was free to run under her own Central African Republican Party. Despite President Kolingba's attempts to have the election annulled, she was elected. Later that year, she was appointed Minister of Social Affairs, Women's Status, and National Solidarity.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Ruth-Rolland resigned from her ministerial position on August 22, 1993, to run for president of the Central African Republic, becoming the first woman in Africa to do so. Despite her popularity as a candidate, she was not elected, receiving only 1% of the vote. Following the election, she resumed her job as Bakouma's deputy and led a gold prospector's consortium in the country's eastern areas.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Ruth-Rolland fell unwell in her latter years and was moved to Paris, France, where she passed on June 4, 1995, at the age of 58, in a hospital.The French daily Le Monde noted in her obituary that Ruth-Rolland "left her mark on Central African political life by her outspokenness." In her honour, a memorial has been created in Bakouma.

      textContent: `<p>
      Djoumbe Fatima, also known as Djoumb√© Soudi, was a powerful and influential queen of the Comoros in the late 19th century. Born in 1837, she was the daughter of the sultan of Moheli, one of the four main islands of the Comoros. She became queen upon the death of her father in 1853 and ruled for 25 years, during which time she gained a reputation as a wise and just ruler.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Djoumbe Fatima was known for her strong and decisive leadership, as well as her ability to navigate the complex political landscape of the Comoros. She was known for her willingness to listen to the concerns of her subjects and for her commitment to maintaining peace and stability on the islands. She also worked to improve the economy of the Comoros, which was largely based on agriculture and fishing at the time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      One of the queen‚Äôs most notable achievements was her role in establishing a close relationship with the French, who had colonised much of Africa at the time. Despite initial resistance from some of her subjects, she saw the potential benefits of a strong alliance with the French, including increased trade and economic opportunities. This alliance allowed the Comoros to remain relatively autonomous while still receiving support from the French government.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Despite her many successes, Djoumbe Fatima‚Äôs reign was not without its challenges. She faced opposition from rival factions on the islands and had to navigate the complexities of balancing the interests of different ethnic groups. She also had to contend with a growing sense of nationalism among her subjects, which sometimes put her at odds with her own people.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In the end, however, Djoumbe Fatima remains one of the most revered figures in the history of the Comoros. She was a visionary leader who helped to lay the foundation for the modern Comoros, and her legacy continues to inspire people to this day. She died in 1878, at the age of 41, leaving behind a legacy of leadership and strength that still resonates in the Comoros today.

      Pauline Lumumba is the widow of Patrice Lumumba, the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the Republic of Congo. Pauline was born in the Belgian Congo in 1937, and she met Patrice while they were both studying at Lovanium University in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). They married in 1951 and had four children together.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Pauline was a strong supporter of her husband's political beliefs and actively participated in the struggle for Congolese independence. She was an advocate for women's rights and education, and she also worked as a teacher.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Patrice Lumumba's rise to power was met with strong opposition from the Belgian government and the Western powers, who saw him as a threat to their interests in the Congo. On January 17, 1961, Patrice was arrested and later executed by the Congolese military, with the support of the Belgian government.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Pauline was devastated by the loss of her husband and the brutal manner in which he was killed. She was also forced to flee the Congo with her children, as they were being targeted by the government, and so she moved to Egypt. Only when her husband was recognized as a national hero by the government, did she move back to Congo.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Despite the challenges she faced, Pauline never gave up on her struggle for justice and freedom. She continued to advocate for the rights of the Congolese people and the memory of her husband. She also worked to educate her children and provide them with a better life.
      She has also been involved in efforts to promote reconciliation and healing in the Congo, and to ensure that the truth about her husband's death is known.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Today, Pauline remains an important figure in the history of the Congo and an inspiration to many. She represents the resilience and determination of the Congolese people and the importance of never giving up on the struggle for freedom and justice.

      Cleopatra VII, also known simply as "Cleopatra," was the last of the Ptolemies, who governed ancient Egypt for about 300 years. Cleopatra controlled an empire that comprised Egypt, Cyprus, a portion of modern-day Libya, and other Middle Eastern territories.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Cleopatra is described in ancient documents and historical study as an intellectual, bilingual female pharaoh who asserted her right to rule Egypt along with other kingdoms.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      According to contemporary Egyptian sources, she was immensely popular among her own people, and she commissioned pictures of herself in the traditional Egyptian style for Egyptian audiences. In addition to retaining her own authority, Cleopatra's foreign policy priority was to keep Egypt independent of the rapidly expanding Roman Empire. She greatly increased Egypt's economy through trading with Eastern nations such as Arabia and possibly as far afield as India, increasing her country's standing as a world power. Cleopatra felt that by allying herself with Roman general Mark Antony, she could prevent Octavian, Julius Caesar's son and Antony's adversary, from making Egypt a vassal of Rome.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Although ancient accounts indicate that Cleopatra and Antony loved one another and that Cleopatra bore Antony three children, the relationship was also incredibly beneficial to an Egyptian queen seeking to develop and maintain her empire.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      The beauty of Cleopatra was unimportant to the Romans who knew her and the Egyptians she governed. The real Cleopatra was attractive because of her intelligence‚Äîwhat Plutarch referred to as "the charm of her conversation" Joann Fletcher describes Pharaoh Cleopatra VII as a brilliant leader. "She was one of the most dynamic figures the world has ever seen. And I don't think that's an exaggeration.

      Neferneferuaten Nefertiti was King Akhenaten's great royal wife and, in modern Western culture, is possibly ancient Egypt's most famous queen, as evidenced by the iconic bust in the Berlin Museum. The Egyptian queen with the greatest number of preserved representations on monuments as well as other artistic mediums is Nefertiti.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Nefertiti is shown as an equal alongside her spouse in tomb and temple wall paintings far more frequently than any other queen in Egyptian history. She is frequently depicted in positions of power and authority, such as smiting her adversaries or driving a chariot. Only Egyptian pharaohs were traditionally shown in this manner, demonstrating what a strong and highly regarded figure she was at the time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Akhenaten and Nefertiti were famed for their devotion to the sun deity Aten, and they were instrumental in igniting a religious revolution. They collaborated to build a new belief system that altered religious practices in Egypt. The country underwent a significant transformation, going from polytheistic to monotheistic worship of one god.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Queen Nefertiti vanished from historical records around the 12th year of Akhenaten's reign. What happened to her is the subject of some speculation. Some historians say she died as a result of the Plague, whereas others claim she assumed a male identity and became co-regent to the pharaoh. However, no one knows for certain what the truth is behind Nefertiti's disappearance. Regardless of whether Nefertiti did not rule as a king, she is unquestionably one of ancient Egypt's most famous queens.

She was a key player in the political manoeuvrings that followed the death of her consort, and her choices and actions profoundly influenced the course of events, making her an important player in the power dynamics of the time
      </p>

      Her political savvy and astuteness are apparent in the way she handled the turbulent political environment of the time, making an indelible mark on Egyptian history. Her ability to manage ancient Egypt's complex political landscape, as well as her position as a major person within the royal court, strengthens her standing as one of the most influential and prominent queens of the time.

      Queen Hatshepsut ruled Egypt for more than 20 years, beginning in 1478 B.C. She ruled as queen alongside her husband, Thutmose II, but following his death, she ascended to the throne as pharaoh while acting as regent for her step-son, Thutmose III. She governed peacefully, erecting temples and monuments, which contributed to Egypt's development.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Hatshepsut was one of just a few female pharaohs in thousands of years of Egyptian history, and she did not inherit her throne like a man would‚Äîonly sons were permitted to succeed their fathers. After her father, King Thutmose I, passed without sons, Hatshepsut married her half-brother, Thutmose II, to enable him ascend to the throne.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Once he died, his son‚ÄîHatshepsut's stepson‚Äîbecame pharaoh despite being just three years old. Hatshepsut governed in his name, yet he was still regarded as the sole ruler of Egypt. But, when Thutmose III was around eight years old, she seized the throne and became his co ruler in 1473 B.C. Some historians believe she made the manoeuvre because she was aware that if they were both pharaohs, they would be too strong to depose. Hatshepsut and Thutmose III would reign as pharaohs together for the following 22 years.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Hatshepsut, considered one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs‚Äîman or woman‚Äîbrought enormous wealth and creativity to her realm. She funded one of Egypt's greatest successful commerce voyages, which brought back gold, ebony, and incense from Punt (possibly modern-day Eritrea). She established her legacy by constructing structures that remain standing today. She erected two hundred-foot-tall obelisks in Karnak's huge temple complex. And she constructed the mortuary Temple of Deir el Bahri, a temple with multiple storeys of columns in front, where she'd be buried.

      Tiye was an Egyptian queen of the 18th dynasty, the wife of Pharaoh Amenhotep III, the mother of Akhenaten, and the grandmother of Tutankhamun and Ankhasenamun. She wielded immense power at the courts of both her husband and son, and she is believed to have interacted directly with foreign kings.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      The Amarna letters also reveal that she was held in high regard by these rulers, particularly during her son's reign. Despite her belief in Egypt's old polytheistic religion, she backed Akhenaten's monotheistic reforms, possibly because she saw them as crucial political manoeuvres to expand the throne's influence at the expense of the priests of Amun.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Tiye was a powerful figure at court from the start of her husband's reign. Bunson writes that she was ‚Äúintelligent and diligent, the first queen of Egypt to have her name on official acts, even on the announcement of the king's marriage to a foreign princess‚Äù. Hawass agrees, stating, ‚ÄúTiye is featured prominently on her husband's monuments, and seems to have borne more real power than the queens who came before her. Her name is even written in a cartouche, like that of the king‚Äù.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Amenhotep III's reign was lavish, and Egypt was the most powerful and wealthy nation in the region, if not the world, so the king was free to spend his fortune on building a large home for his queen at Malkata, across the river from Thebes and his father's old palace.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      She passed away in her early sixties and was laid to rest in the Valley of the Kings. Her mummy has been positively identified as the 'Elder Lady,' and a lock of her hair, probably a keepsake of the young king, was discovered in Tutankhamun's tomb.

      Swazi Queen-Mother Labotsibeni Mdluli, the founder and financier of Abantu Batho, was a force to be reckoned with.
      Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli was born in 1858 in Luhlekweni, northern Swaziland (now known as Eswatini), during the reign of King Mswati II, who ruled for 25 years from 1840 to 1865. She would reign the nascent Swaziland kingdom for 50 years, as fate would have it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      She spent her whole reign disputing British claims to her people's land and attempting to repurchase territory that her husband had given as concessions to the Boers and the British in an intricate system of awarding land, grazing pasture, and mining rights. The Swazis controlled just about one-third of their area after the Land Partition Proclamation of 1909. Labotsibeni admitted that she couldn't reclaim the property militarily and that it had become a commodity that could be bought and sold on the open market.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      During World War I, Queen Labotsibeni purchased a ¬£1000 aircraft for Britain to aid in its war efforts. She demanded that the plane bear her name in order to commemorate and acknowledge the involvement of women in World War I.

      When she died in 1925, there was a strong rainstorm that caused flooding in portions of South Africa and Swaziland. She was a rainmaker who was quoted as saying, "When I want water, I make the rain myself."

      <p>
      One of Taytu's most notable achievements was her role in the Battle of Adwa in 1896. The Ethiopian army, led by Menelik, defeated the Italian forces in a surprise victory, solidifying Ethiopia's independence and becoming one of the few African countries to successfully resist European colonisation. Taytu was said to have played a key role in the victory by rallying the troops and providing strategic advice to her husband.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Taytu is widely recognized for her significant political influence, both preceding and following her coronation as Empress alongside Menelik in 1889. She spearheaded the conservative faction within the court, which opposed the modernists and progressives seeking to westernise Ethiopia and introduce modern reforms. Historians affirm that the Emperor always sought her counsel prior to making crucial decisions, highlighting her integral role in the decision-making process.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Empress Taytu Batul died in 1918, leaving behind a legacy of strength, intelligence, and dedication to her country. Her contributions to Ethiopia's history and development continue to be celebrated and remembered to this day.

      <p>
      Demonstrating her entrepreneurial spirit, she made and sold jam  for a shilling, yielding a commendable two-shilling profit. However, her decision to sell jam on the streets drew criticism from her classmates at Achimota School, who deemed it an unrefined pursuit unfit for an educated individual.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Undeterred by the opinions of others, she ingeniously presented some leftover marmalade to her former school, which led to a lucrative contract to supply jam for the entire boarding school. Recognizing her potential, the administrators of Achimota approached her with an offer to supply orange juice as well, utilising the abundant fruit grown on school premises. As her reputation as a proficient businesswoman flourished, she secured a substantial contract to supply juice to the country's military, solidifying her position as a successful entrepreneur.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In 1942, she established her first factory. Over the course of the following decades, she embarked on the establishment of multiple non-governmental organisations (NGOs), primarily focusing on empowering underprivileged youth and women across various regions of the country. These organisations placed significant emphasis on equipping individuals with practical skills that would enhance their employability, fostering self-sufficiency and empowerment among the targeted communities.
      </p>

      Despite her many achievements, Ocloo remained humble and dedicated to her work. Her legacy continues to inspire many people in Ghana and other parts of Africa, who see her as a role model for women entrepreneurs. Ocloo's work has helped thousands of women in Africa to start their own businesses, improve their economic situation, and become more independent and self-sufficient.

      The first Rain Queen Maselekwane I, was a powerful figure in the Balobedu tribe in South Africa during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

      Viola Desmond was a civil rights activist who fought for the rights of Black people in Canada. She was born on July 6, 1914, in Halifax, Nova Scotia and grew up in a family of entrepreneurs. Her father owned a successful barber shop, and her mother was a hairdresser. This upbringing instilled in her a strong sense of self-reliance and determination, qualities that would serve her well in her later life as a civil rights activist.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In 1946, Desmond was travelling to Sydney, Nova Scotia, to attend a beauty school. During her trip, her car broke down in New Glasgow, and she decided to watch a movie while she waited for it to be fixed. She went to the Roseland Theatre, but was told that she could only sit in the balcony, which was reserved for Black people. Desmond refused to move and was subsequently arrested and charged with tax evasion.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Desmond's arrest was a pivotal moment in Canadian civil rights history. It galvanised the Black community and brought attention to the ongoing struggles for equality and justice. The incident was widely reported in the press and inspired other Black people to challenge the segregation policies of the time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      After her release from jail, Desmond became an activist and used her voice to speak out against the segregation policies that Black people faced in Canada. She sued the theatre and the government for damages, but the case was eventually dismissed. Despite this setback, Desmond continued to fight for the rights of Black people and inspired a new generation of activists in Canada.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Viola Desmond's legacy continues to live on in Canada today. In 2018, she was honoured with a postage stamp and was the first Canadian woman to be featured on a banknote. She remains an inspiration to all who believe in the power of standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity. Her story is a testament to the strength and resilience of the human spirit, and a reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and justice for all people.

      Carolina Maria de Jesus was born on March 14th, 1914 in Minas Gerais. Most of her life she lived in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Her parents were sharecroppers. Her father was a married man already when her mom got pregnant, so he didn‚Äôt really pay mind to her. Carolina was never introduced to school until her mother‚Äôs landowner‚Äôs wife paid for her education and other poor black children in the neighbourhood. She stopped going to school by the second grade, which was long enough for her to know how to read and write. Her family was not allowed to attend the neighbourhood Catholic Church; because her mother had two children with married men. This didn‚Äôt stop Carolina from believing in her religion, she stood a devoted Catholic.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In the year 1937, she was forced to move to the metropolis of Sao Paulo after her mom passed away. She was forced to create her home out of cardboard, cans and anything that was available around her. Carolina made herself responsible that her family had all the necessary, every night she would collect paper and resell it the next day, and with that money she would buy food. Her family consisted of three children, Vera Eunice, Jose Carlos, and Joao Jose. All her children had different fathers, one being a white rich guy. She began her writing in journals that she would find in the street and in them she would write down her everyday struggle and life in the favela. Her neighbours weren‚Äôt a fan of her; they hated seeing her write because they didn‚Äôt know how to. Carolina was never the type to have a settled relationship, even though she was an attractive female. She had experienced seeing too much domestic violence in the favelas; therefore, never sought marriage and rather depended on herself.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Carolina‚Äôs diary was published in August 1960 into thirteen languages. It is known as a best seller in North America and Europe. In New York City it was published as Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus in 1962. In her diary she wrote about how poverty, struggles and other circumstances from living in the favelas can cause desperation for families. Her diary had actual real names, therefore; her neighbours despised her and she became a social victim after the publication. Her family was thrown pots and rocks, especially after she moved into a brick house with the money she received from her book. In 1960, her book The Garbage place, was published and it became the most successful book in Brazilian publishing history.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Carolina was able to accomplish her dreams of becoming a writer without the help of others. She brought awareness of the living conditions in the favelas that made politicians and the Governor of Sao Paulo to begin projects that would show women how to care for their families, sew and know good hygiene. She was unique, because even being categorized as lowest in society didn't stop her from having aspirations. After her Diary, she had four additional books. Carolina passed away on February 13, 1977.

    Lu√≠sa Mahin was a prominent figure in the history of Brazil and is remembered for her involvement in multiple slave revolts. Born in the 18th century, she was a slave who fought against the brutalities of slavery and the injustices inflicted upon her people. She was known for her bravery and leadership skills, which made her a respected figure among the enslaved communities.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Lu√≠sa claimed to be of African nobility and was born sometime in the 1800s in either the Gulf of Benin, West Africa, or Bahia (her actual birthplace and year of birth are unknown). Based on her surname, she is thought to be a member of the Mahi tribe from the Nag√¥ (a subdivision of the Yoruba) country, who practised Islam. Lu√≠sa Mahin is well known for her involvement with numerous of the slave revolts and uprisings that took place in Bahia during the early part of the nineteenth century.

      She is claimed to have been crowned "Queen of Bahia" if the Mal√™ Revolt had been victorious. What happened to Lu√≠sa Mahin is unknown. According to other stories, she fled to Rio de Janeiro before being apprehended and repatriated to Angola. According to legend, she fled to Maranho, where she resided and influenced Afro-Brazilian culture. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Despite her efforts, slavery continued to exist in Brazil until 1888, when it was finally abolished. However, the legacy of Lu√≠sa Mahin continues to inspire people around the world and is a testament to the courage and determination of the slaves who fought for their freedom. She remains an important figure in Brazilian history, reminding us of the struggles of the enslaved and their unwavering fight for justice and equality.

      textContent: `<p>
      Virginia Brindis de Salas was the first published black woman writer in Uruguay. She was born on September 18, 1908 in the capital, Montevideo, to Jos√© Salas and Maria Blanca Rodriguez. Afro Latinos in Uruguay as elsewhere in Latin America are the descendants of enslaved people. In Uruguay, where 92 percent of citizens trace their ancestry to Europe, Afro and Native Uruguayans have had to fight for visibility, while whiteness has been emphasised in mainstream national life.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In Latin America, these larger currents among the black diaspora solidified in what is known as the Negritude movement. Brindis de Salas was part of a group of black artists and intellectuals, including Juan Julio Arrascaeta, Carlos Cardioso Pereira, and Pilar Barrios, who came of age in the 1930s and 1940s and began to assert a black identity and pride among Afro Uruguayans. Groups like the Circle of Black Intellectuals, Artists, Journalists, and Writers (1935) and the Black Uruguayan Association of Culture and Society provided institutional support to promote the black arts.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      De Salas contributed her poetry to the black artistic journal Nuestra Raza (Our Race), she was a co-founder of the political party Partido Autoctono Negro (the Black Native Party). Her best-known works were published in the poetry collections entitled Pregon de Marimorena (1946) and Cien Careles de Amor (1949)‚ÄîMary Morena‚Äôs Call and One Hundred Prisons of Love, respectively. Virginia Brindis de Salas‚Äôs work, although overlooked in her home country for years, was certainly influential among black artists and activists outside of her homeland, as Chilean, German, and U.S.-born writers and activists have all pointed to her importance.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest in the contributions of Afro Latinos to the larger national cultures of Latin America. An important anthology showcasing the works of black writers from the western hemisphere was published, and it included some of Virginia de Salas‚Äôs works. Questions arose about Virginia Brindis de Salas as the actual author of her poetry. Another poet, Julio Guadalupe tried to take credit but his claims about authorship have been debunked.

      Argelia Laya was an Afro-Venezuelan educator and women‚Äôs rights activist. She fought for women‚Äôs suffrage and was one of the first to openly speak of a woman‚Äôs right to have children outside of wedlock or obtain an abortion.  She served as a guerrilla fighter for the communist party in Venezuela and she was one of the founders of the Movement to Socialism (MAS), pressing for anti-discrimination regulations to gain socio-economic parity for minorities, workers, and women.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In 1946, Laya co-founded the National Union of Women Organization (Organizaci√≥n de la Uni√≥n Nacional de Mujeres) and served as the secretary of the organisation for over a decade. She called for debates and urged that women be granted suffrage. During her early years of teaching, Laya had a child and as an unmarried mother was suspended from teaching for her immorality. From this personal experience, Laya started fighting against women‚Äôs discrimination and she wrote a letter of protest to the Education Minister, advocating her right to be unmarried and have a child. After several months, she became more vocal about the ways in which women faced discrimination. Recognizing that it was not just teachers who were barred from their jobs but that pregnant students were also suspended from school, Laya pressed for reforms so that all citizens' universal right to education was recognized.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In the early 1970s, she joined and founded a splinter group of the communist party, the Movement to Socialism (MAS). As one of the founders, Laya was the first woman to occupy such a high position in any political party in Venezuela. Working to build the new party, she pressed for a code of ethics to be established for the protection of workers, laws to prohibit violence against women, and pushed for regulations to prevent discrimination and injustices toward Afro-Venezuelans and other minorities, peasants, and women.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In the 1980s, Laya served on the Women‚Äôs Advisory Commission to the Presidency of the Republic and she took part in the civil code reforms to eliminate discrimination in adoption procedures to protect both mothers and children‚Äôs rights. In 1985, she was selected to attend the United Nations Third World Conference on Women, held in Nairobi, Kenya as the Venezuelan delegate. In 1994 she attended the First Meeting to Discuss Women and Education in Bolivia. There, she helped draft a program for eliminating sexism through education. The plan called for gender issues to become integral parts of study and dialogue throughout the entirety of one‚Äôs education.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Argelia Laya died on 27 November 1997 in Caracas. To this day, she is still regarded as one of the most influential female leaders in Venezuelan history. Throughout Venezuela, there are programs and policies related to gender equality that bear her name.

      </p>
      <br>

Nevertheless, she was beloved by the soldiers she treated, and many wrote of their gratitude and admiration for her in letters home.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      After the war, Seacole returned to Britain, where she was honoured by many of the soldiers she had treated. Despite her popularity, however, she was financially ruined and lived in poverty for the rest of her life.

      Women were denied the ability to vote under Cuba's 1901 Constitution, which was created after the island won its independence from Spain. To fight for their rights, a large feminist movement had emerged by the 1920s. A leader in the making was Pilar Jorge de Tella. She was a founding member of the Feminine Club and National Women's Congress, two of the most significant organisations at the time that brought together feminist organisations to discuss tactics and ideas. Jorge de Tella adopted divisive political positions. She supported safeguards for children born outside of marriage, access to birth control, education, child care, and better working conditions. Despite the fact that some of these views offended conservative women, feminists ultimately united around suffrage and won the right to vote in 1934.

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Mam√° Ting√≥ was an advocate for the rights of poor farmers, who were facing exploitation by large landowners and the government. She organised and led protests and demonstrations, calling for better working conditions, fair wages, and access to land. Her activism inspired many other poor farmers to join her movement, and she became a symbol of hope and resistance in the face of injustice.

      Following the start of the land seizures in 1974, Mam√° Ting√≥ quickly became a member of the Federation of Christian Agriculture Leagues.

She calmly implored B√©lair to die heroically as she watched his death, before proceeding to her own execution, unwilling to wear a blindfold.When threatened with beheading, she is reported to have successfully defended her right to an honourable soldier's death by musketry, standing before their muzzles and yelling "Viv lib√®te!"

      textContent: `<p>
      Adbaraya Toya is celebrated as one of the bravest women in Haitian history for her great influence on the many that fought in the Haitian Revolution. Popularly known as Victoria Montou in Haiti, a name she is believed to have been given after arriving in Haiti from Africa to work as a slave like the many other Africans who were forced out of their lands into the new world.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Adbaraya Toya was abducted from the Dahomey Empire which is now modern Benin. Several sources indicate that before her abduction, Adbaraya was a soldier and member of the council of women in the Kingdom. She was also a healer.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Her high position in the Dahomey Kingdom as a member of the women‚Äôs council and soldier suggests that Adbaraya Toya was a member of the warrior group Dahomey Amazons which fought to protect the Dahomey kingdom. The Dahomey warriors were traditionally called the N‚ÄôNonmiton, which means ‚Äúour mothers‚Äù in Fon, the language of the Fon people of Dahomey, now in present-day Benin. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      It is possible that Adbaraya was abducted during a battle or raid and sold into slavery in Haiti where she was given the name Victoria, a name which means to conquer, giving more evidence to her Dahomey Amazon roots.
      Adbaraya Toya worked on the Cormier Sugar Plantation and became very close friends with Marie Elisabeth who was the mother of Jean Jacques Dessalines and entrusted her son into Adbaraya‚Äôs care before she died. Jean Jacques referred to Adbaraya as aunty which would make many believe that he was really related to her. However, while Adbaraya comes from present-day Benin, Jean Jacques traces his roots to Guinea.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Adbaraya taught Jean Jacques how to fight as a soldier. She taught him skills such as hand-to-hand combat and how to throw a knife as well as physical manoeuvres to defend himself in battle.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      After gaining her freedom through the rebellion, Adbaraya set up an indigenous army to support the revolution. Despite being very old at the time of the Haitian Revolution which was being led by Jean Jacques, Adbaraya trained and led her troop to fight and was made the leader of the military by Jean Jacques Dessalines.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In her last battle, it is said that she fought off three soldiers and was severely wounded. After her death, a state funeral was held in her honour and she was celebrated as the mother of Haiti‚Äôs independence.

      Catherine Flon was a Haitian seamstress who is remembered for her role in creating the first Haitian flag. During the Haitian Revolution, Flon was approached by the leaders of the revolutionary movement and asked to sew a flag to represent Haiti as a newly independent nation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      According to popular sources, Flon was not only a seamstress but also an enthusiastic supporter of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804), during which she served as a nurse in a non-combatant but supportive capacity.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      The Haitian national flag was designed at a three-day convention of several revolutionary groups in May 1803, which was held at Archaye. Dessalines is reported to have symbolically removed the white vertical band from the French tricolour flag during this convention, leaving only the red and blue bands.  According to most sources, Flon then sewed together the remaining bands. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      The design of Haiti's national flag has evolved over the two centuries since the country proclaimed independence. All artistic depictions of Catherine Flon, however, show her stitching the blue and red bars of the French tricolour after her godfather cut out the white.
      </p>
      <br>
